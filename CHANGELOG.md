### 🎉 Celebrating Open Source

Initial public release of **vowl**.

**Background:**

- vowl originated as an internal tool for demonstrating data contracts within our prototyping workflows. Over time, we recognised its potential value to the wider international community.
- With that in mind, we refined the library and published it as open source.
- As the project is still in its early stages, there may be rough edges and bugs. We appreciate your patience and warmly welcome contributions to help improve vowl for everyone.

### Added
- Core SQL-powered data quality validation engine backed by Ibis and DuckDB.
- Contract-based validation with YAML/JSON schema definitions.
- Adapters for pandas, Spark, and database backends (DuckDB attach).
- CTE wrapper for robust query transformation and complex query support.
- Multi-table and multi-source materialisation support.
- Export results as Arrow tables.
- Jupyter notebook examples and demo outputs.
- MkDocs documentation site (architecture, contracts, usage patterns).
- MIT license.
- GitHub Actions CI for testing, linting, and PyPI publishing.
- `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES` and `LICENSE_AUDIT_REPORT.md`.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` with development setup and release workflow.
